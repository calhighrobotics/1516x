# Notebook Guidelines

## Images

- Photography should always have rounded edges and default drop shadow applied
- Digital images are up to interpretation, however images like graphs and
sketches should always have drop shadow and drop shadow applied
- Code only screenshots should always be flat

## Miscellaneous

### Regarding incomplete pages

If you are filling out a template, highlight the text that is left incomplete (includes "continued from page..." and fig #), so we can identify it as incomplete and go back and fix it before printing.

## Management Notebook

- A brief summary of meetings should be updated to notebook or on discord for each meeting.
- To show task progress, make sure the same tasks are always named the same thing across pages and make sure all tasks have an end (the latest page on a task should have it marked down as completed, green).

## Programming

Entries should revolve around:
> Descriptions of programming concepts, programming improvements, or significant
> programming modifications
