# About the Wiki

Team 1516X is a *Vex V5 Robotics Competition* team based out of San Ramon, California. In this wiki, we try to explain the workings of our robot and how they were implemented from a high level perspective. This wiki resembles the extremely well made *[BLRS Wiki](https://wiki.purduesigbots.com/)*.

However, Purdue SIGbots designed their wiki as a knowledge base for information about robotics and about the VEX ecosystem, while this wiki tries to take a more *example driven* approach by focusing on describing our robot, and our specific insights and findings.
